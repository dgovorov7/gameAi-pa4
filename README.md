Implementation of decision transfomers for [VectorRTS](https://github.com/drchangliu/RL4SE/tree/main/enn/TensorRTS)

Currently alot of the code is based off of this [notebook](https://github.com/huggingface/blog/blob/main/notebooks/101_train-decision-transformers.ipynb) and using many of the huggingface transfomers libraries.
Alot of my implemenation feels very hacky, be it because huggingface's libraries arent designed with reinforcment learning in mind, and the unfamilirization I have with these librares. At some point I plan to dig through the code from the original [decison transformers gitub](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer) and other papers that build apon this
